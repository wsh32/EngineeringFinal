{"name":"The Asian Equation","tagline":"","body":"# The Asian Equation\r\nThe Asian Equation is a team of 5 high school students. Together, we have been tasked with creating a DIY kit that will spark a child's interest in the Engineering or Robotics fields.\r\n\r\n### Broom Broom\r\nThe Asian Equation has created Broom Broom, a driving catapult. This comprises of over 60 individual pieces, which are to be assembled by a child. Assembling this increases a child's self confidence, motor ability, and interest in engineering and robotics.\r\n\r\nThe Broom Broom features two main parts: a drive base and a catapult. The drive base comprises of four wheels which are used to successfully maneuver. The catapult utilizes a \"teeter totter\" system to launch a 1\" diameter plastic ball.\r\n\r\nThe Broom Broom is designed to be an introduction to engineers for young children, thus no prior engineering experience is needed. Included with the kit is a guide for quick and easy assembly.\r\n\r\nThe Broom Broom is run using an Arduino as the control module. The Arduinos provided are preprogrammed and wiring for the controller and robot are outlined in the guide.\r\n\r\nMost importantly, the Broom Broom robotics kit is affordable for the common person. While other robotics kits costs range from $300 to over $1000, the Broom Broom is estimated to cost just a light $150.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nThe Asian Equation is comprised of:\r\n* [Tram Bui](http://github.com/tramhbui)\r\n* [Nathan Obrique](http://github.com/Nolomon37)\r\n* [Caitlynn Rosales](http://github.com/caitlynnrosales)\r\n* [Wesley Soo-Hoo](http://github.com/wsh32)\r\n* [Angelina Truong](http://github.com/awesomedolphin101)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
