# Group Norms

1. Be punctual. Do not be late unless given prior notification before the meeting.
2. Show up to at least 75 percent of meetings -- either physically or virtually.
3. Contribute to group discussion.
4. Meetings are for project-related activities. Do not bring outside activities to the meeting. Stay on topic.
5. Respect each other.

### Failure to follow group norms results in:
- First occurrence: A one-page writing assignment (the rest of the members of the team members will decide the topic that will be tailored to the failure the member made).
- Second occurrence: At least two percent of the member’s final grade will be deducted.

**When conflict occurs:**
Decision matrix will be made to evaluate the validity of each side/idea
